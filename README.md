# Axim_T12_Extractor
Automated T12 Layer-1 Financial Extractor: A structural financial modeling engine that programmatically deconstructs unstructured Trailing-12 statements. Unlike keyword-based parsers, this uses a Summation Trail Audit to mathematically prove the relationship between granular accounts (Layer 1) and synthetic totals (Layers 2-4).
